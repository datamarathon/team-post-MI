Shock Post MI
========

Comparison of pressors for treatment of myocardial-infarction-related
cardiogenic shock.

The SOAP II trial is the major RCT available comparing different
vasopressors. However, it combines all types of shock. Norepinephrine
looked better in the cardiogenic shock subgroup, but this also
combines all types of cardiogenic shock. We want to determine what is
the best pressor, *specifically* for myocardial-infarction-related
cardiogenic shock.

This is code written by our team during the second Critical Data
hackathon at MIT, September 5-7, 2014. We are querying the MIMIC II
Database. This is a publicly and freely available clinical database
that encompasses a large population of ICU patients and includes lab
results, electronic documentation, and bedside monitor trends and
waveforms.
