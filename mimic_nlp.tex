The Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care II
(MIMIC-II) database consists of clinical data on about 32,000
intensive care unit (ICU) admissions at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical
Center from 2001--2008.\footnote{Saeed M, Villarroel M, Reisner AT,

It grabs floor data.

deceased patients without signing anything at all. Waveforms also do
not require DUA. How to get full access: do online human research

I've participated in hackathons.

Favorite tables.
