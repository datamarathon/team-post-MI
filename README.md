Shock Post MI
========

Comparison of pressors for treatment of myocardial-infarction-related
cardiogenic shock.

The SOAP II trial is the major RCT available comparing different
vasopressors. However, it combines all types of shock. Norepinephrine
looked better in the cardiogenic shock subgroup, but this also
combines all types of cardiogenic shock. We want to determine what is
the best pressor, *specifically* for myocardial-infarction-related
cardiogenic shock.
